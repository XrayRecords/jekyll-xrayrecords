CASUAL CORNER: THE NEW LP FROM BLESST CHEST

XRay Records is proud to announce the release of ‘Casual Corner’ the second full length LP from Portland’s own Blesst Chest. Casual Corner finds the cagey veterans of Portland’s early aughts scene reaching for new sonic heights while maintaining their fat trimmed riffage that earned them acclaim. Recorded by Adam Lee at Halfling Studio in Northwest Portland in December of 2017, Casual Corner finds Blesst Chest pushing the boundaries of their self coined “micro-prog” sound. Incorporating elements of Motown, Roxy Music and Mudhoney, at times all in one song, Casual Corner is a snapshot of Blesst Chest moving forward.
