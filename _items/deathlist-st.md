"Deathlist is the solo recording project of Summer Cannibals bassist Jenny Logan. [Her] self-titled debut [is] six tracks of frenzied punk rock that riff wildly until they're caught in a buzzy entanglement of guitar-driven chaos. Standout track "Every Wish" plays like a slow-dance duet sung by these hyperactive electric guitar parts and Logan, who asks in a subdued tone, "How do you know it ends tonight?"

-Portland Mercury
