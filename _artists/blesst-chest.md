Welcome Komrades to the Blesst Chest promo sheet. I’m psyched to be hearing this album. Takes me way back (two years) to the Halcyon Sweat Beer Days and their many gigs at godforsaken shitboxes around Portland. The boys wouldn’t have it any other way: “Paying dues” is standard operating procedure. Months and months were spent in the rehearsal room to get to this point— because what else would you do with your precious free time?

There is a Working Man’s Humility to their Prog Rock Leanings. I hear the desperation of the Everyman… but also his ability to Cope through EXXXTREME RIFFAGE!!! Sure, there isn’t anyplace to get to. Ambition is a construct meant to enslave you; But for an hour, at least, lets play hard and loud together in Brotherly Patrimony.

The album sounds like a Beefier version of their already Beefed Up live show. For a couple shekels, you can buy this LP and pretty much be there at the gig with us (even though you probably weren’t). And where the Boys will go next, if they deign to play these jams in your town soon, well now you know a bit what’s in store for ya!

I’ve been saving the worst for last. I doubt they will show their faces on the cover but trust me they are Dead Foxxy—especially remarkable for an Instrumental Power Trio. I guess what I’m saying is…
