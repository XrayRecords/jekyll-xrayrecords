"The Lo-fi recording boom rose to prominence in the late 80's when new recording technology brought 4-tracks within teenager's grasp at an affordable price. Then only a few years later, Nirvana opened up the commercial market for underground music and virtually all of the home-recording pioneers stepped out of their shabby environments towards a new horizon of recording studio budgets. Simultaneously the 'lo-fi movement' was proclaimed dead by the press for the next decade. Not until Ariel Pink arrived would people consider the weirdo genre of home-recording ready to be stocked on store shelves again... and in this unfashionable dead-zone is where the Lost Decade series was made in private.

Lost Decade is a rare look into the mountain of recordings Emil Amos amassed while in full-swing of the initial lo-fi revolution. There's a palpable stench of pot smoke swirling around these late-night recordings and a constant sense of supreme alienation. This batch of Lost Decade tapes is taken from a crucial time of Emil's development (1996-2002) that he spends a lot of time going into on his acclaimed podcast "Drifter's Sympathy". These recordings are tangibly haunted and plagued by a distinct sense of 'spiritual trouble'... trapped in amber and mashed into a near-ambient distillation of confusion and suffering."
